# First-Game
A repository for my friends and I to discuss our first game.

# Disclaimer
More Instructions WILL be added.

"master" will be our final copy

# Important News

If I find a way to organize easier I will notify you ASAP.

# Organize

We will all start on branch 1, we will have our branches that we work on named after us (Example: [Name]) 
When we finish our branches I will merge them, if you finish faster than others, you shall help the rest of the group.
We will keep moving with the branches until I (Jay Zen) finish with the master copy.
As soon as we all finish with a branch, I will merge them all, then I will delete them and we will move on. ex: We finish branch one, we help the rest finish, then I merge them, then I delete the branches, and then we move on to branch 2.

If you get a few tasks, just name the branches like this, [Name] [Task] [No.]. Ex: JayZen UpgradeFunctions. 4
MAKE SURE TASK NAME IS DESCRIPTIVE!!!
I will assign each of you a few tasks and you will work on those on your branches.
